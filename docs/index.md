## 🔭 About Me

I am an experienced IT specialist with a passion for everything related to Linux, automation, and DevOps. Over the last twelve years, I've developed skills that have allowed me to design, implement, and manage technologically advanced infrastructures.

## 💼 Professional Experience

My journey to becoming a DevOps specialist has been filled with intense, self-planned weeks of learning and practice. Starting with the fundamentals of DevOps and Git, I solidified my knowledge of continuous integration and code versioning. I immersed myself in the world of containerization, mastering Docker and Docker Compose, which are essential for creating flexible and scalable environments.

My focus on networking and security has equipped me to manage complex network infrastructures and reverse proxies, as well as to configure VPNs for secure connections. My experiences with Traefik, Nginx Proxy Manager, and security measures based on CrowdSec have made me proficient in ensuring system reliability and security.

Implementing effective backup strategies and utilizing monitoring tools like Grafana, InfluxDB, and Prometheus, along with setting up notifications with Gotify and Watchtower, have transformed my ability to ensure operational continuity and respond to incidents.
